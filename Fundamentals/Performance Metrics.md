## Performance Metrics

4 factors to consider while evaluating performance metrics:
- **`Throughput`**: The amount of data that can be processed or transmitted over a network in a given amount of time.It's often measured in data units per second like bytes per second (Bps), Kilobytes per second (KBps), Megabytes per second (MBps), etc.
- **`Bandwidth`**: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network. It represents the theoretical upper limit of data transfer and often measured in the same units as throughput, bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), megabits per second (mbps), etc.
- **`Latency`**: The time it takes for a data packet to travel from the sender to the receiver and back. It's often measured in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (Âµs).
- **`Response Time`**: The time it takes for a system to respond to a user request. It includes the time taken to process the request and the time taken to transmit the response back to the user. It's often measured in milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s).

Lets' understand these metrics with an example:

Imagine you're downloading a file from the internet. 

1. **Bandwidth**: The internet connection you're using has a bandwidth of 100 Mbps (Megabits per second). This means the maximum rate of data transfer across the network is 100 Mbps.
2. **Throughput**: Due to network congestion, the actual data transfer rate is 50 Mbps. This is the throughput.
3. **Latency**: It takes 50 milliseconds for a data packet to travel from the server to your device and back. This is the latency.
4. **Response** Time: When you request to download the file and the file starts downloading after 200ms, the time taken to process the request and start the download is the response time.
