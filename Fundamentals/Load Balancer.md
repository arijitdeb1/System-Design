## what are the suggested solutions when the connection limit is reached

When you reach the connection limits on an AWS load balancer, the appropriate solution depends on the specific cause and the type of load balancer involved. For example, a Network Load Balancer (NLB) might encounter port allocation errors, while an Application Load Balancer (ALB) might experience performance degradation under heavy request volume.

### For Network Load Balancer (NLB) port allocation errors
Port allocation errors occur with an NLB when it exceeds approximately 55,000 simultaneous connections or 55,000 connections per minute to a unique target (IP address and port). This happens when client IP address preservation is disabled or with PrivateLink traffic.
- **Add more targets to the target group:** This is the most direct solution. Distributing traffic across more targets spreads the connection load and reduces the chances of a single target exceeding its port capacity.
- **Use multiple IP addresses for the target:** For NLBs where client IP preservation is disabled, you can register a target with multiple IP addresses to increase the number of available ports. This applies to targets like EC2 instances that have been configured with secondary IP addresses.

### For Application Load Balancer (ALB) over-utilization
ALBs manage connections using "Load Balancer Capacity Units" (LCUs), and a connection limit is not a fixed cap but rather a function of the total workload. When your back-end instances are overwhelmed, you will see a surge in metrics like UnHealthyHostCount and HTTPCode_ELB_5XX.

- **Use auto-scaling:** The most scalable solution is to place your EC2 instances behind an Auto Scaling group.
- **Improve target efficiency:** If your instances are consistently over-utilized, it may indicate a bottleneck in your application. Optimizing your application to process requests more efficiently will reduce the demand on each instance and allow it to handle more connections.
- **Pre-warm the load balancer**
