# NGINX vs Apache: A Comparison

| Feature                        | NGINX                              | Apache                              |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**               | Event-driven, asynchronous         | Process-driven, thread-based       |
| **Concurrency Handling**       | Handles multiple connections efficiently using a single thread. | Each request is handled by a separate thread or process. |
| **Static Content Performance** | Faster due to non-blocking I/O     | Slower for static content          |
| **Dynamic Content Performance**| Relies on FastCGI, uWSGI, or external handlers for dynamic content | Processes dynamic content natively using modules (e.g., PHP, Python) |
| **Configuration**              | Uses a simple, declarative configuration format | Modular configuration with `.htaccess` support |
| **Memory Usage**               | Lower memory footprint             | Higher memory usage                |
| **Reverse Proxy**              | Built-in and optimized             | Requires additional configuration  |
| **Load Balancing**             | Advanced built-in capabilities     | Basic features available with modules |
| **Modules**                    | Pre-compiled, no dynamic loading   | Supports dynamically loadable modules |
| **Platform**                   | High-performance, suitable for modern web apps | Versatile and widely supported for legacy systems |
| **Popularity**                 | Widely used for high-traffic sites | Commonly used for traditional hosting |
| **Ease of Use**                | Simpler for high-performance setups | Easier for small-scale applications or shared hosting |
| **HTTPS Support**              | Strong HTTPS support with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 | HTTPS support with HTTP/2         |
| **Community & Documentation**  | Active community, growing rapidly  | Long-established, extensive documentation |

`FastCGI` is a protocol like http for transferring binary data.
